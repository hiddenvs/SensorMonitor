# SensorMonitor
Arduino based sketch for testing misc sensors

Actual revision contains:
TFT LCD display based on Adafruit GFX library with SPFD5408 (ILI9341) shield and Arduino Mega 2560 board. It's connected also to SHT11 sensor, MPX4115A sensor and small 4x4 membrane keyboard. 

Plans:
Should be also connected to DS3221 RTC and some kind from UV light sensor.
